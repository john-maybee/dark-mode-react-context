# dark-mode-react-context

This is a simple example of how to use React Context to manage dark mode in a React app.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

<!-- ## How it works -->

<!-- The `App` component is wrapped in a `DarkModeProvider` component. This component is responsible for managing the dark mode state and providing it to the rest of the app. It also provides a `toggleDarkMode` function that can be used to toggle the dark mode state. The `DarkModeProvider` component is defined in `src/context/DarkModeContext.js`.

The `DarkModeProvider` component is used in `src/index.js` to wrap the `App` component. This makes the dark mode state available to the entire app.

The `DarkModeProvider` component is also used in `src/components/Navbar.js` to wrap the `Navbar` component. This makes the dark mode state available to the `Navbar` component.

The `Navbar` component uses the dark mode state to determine which icon to display in the navbar. It also uses the `toggleDarkMode` function to toggle the dark mode state when the icon is clicked. -->
